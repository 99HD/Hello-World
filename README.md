# Hello-World
 I believe that everyone deserves a shot at redemption.
Other presents come when you least expect them.
Honesty is your best defense and offense.
You can never replace anyone because everyone is made of such beautiful specific details.
But why wait? Dream is now.
You can't give up on it. Never surrender.
